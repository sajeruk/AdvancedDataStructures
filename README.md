Advanced Data Structures by sajeruk
Hello! This is my C++ library, which provides unusual enough data structures,
which can be useful for solving several tasks.

what do we have here now?
1) Stack with extremal element for O(1)
2) Queue with extremal element for O(1)

This library is developing, but now i don't have enough time for it
In future there will be fibonacci heap, different types of trees, etc.

It will be useful library for thouse, who like different algo cometitions
(topcoder, codeforces), and need simple working code, which, by the way, can
be easily copied and pasted to one solution file. The reason is, that many
contests require your source file (usually only one), so it's hard enough to
use smthing except standart library
